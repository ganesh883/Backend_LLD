echo "# Backend_LLD

**Backend_LLD** is my personal practice space for building and experimenting with backend **low-level design (LLD)** concepts. It’s a sandbox to practice clean architecture, modular code, and common design patterns.

---

## 🔹 Features
- Sample backend modules and service components
- Implementation of design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, etc.)
- Class structures and API design for learning purposes
- Focus on maintainable, scalable, and modular code

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/ganesh883/Backend_LLD.git
cd Backend_LLD
\`\`\`
- Explore modules and their design
- Run sample code in your IDE (if applicable)
- Extend or refactor code to practice LLD principles

---

## 📚 Purpose
A personal sandbox to practice and improve backend low-level design skills.

---

## 🤝 Contributing
- Fork or clone to experiment
- Open PRs for improvements or refactoring suggestions
- Explain design decisions when contributing
